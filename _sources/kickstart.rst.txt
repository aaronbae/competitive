Kick Start
==============
Kick Start is coding competition hosted by Google. I will be competing in the
first of the following Kick Start events. Here is a blob from the official
Kick Start Team of Google:

    "Kick Start offers coders around the world the chance to develop and hone
    their programming skills through online-hosted competition rounds. The
    three-hour rounds feature a variety of algorithmic challenges, all developed
    by Google engineers so that you get a taste of the technical skills needed
    for a career at Google (the top competitors from our Kick Start rounds may
    be invited to interview at Google!). Our rounds are held regularly
    throughout the year at different times so they are easily accessible to
    coders everywhere. Each Kick Start Round is open to all participants, no
    pre-qualification needed, so you can try your hand at one or give them all
    a shot."
