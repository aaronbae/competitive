Hash Code
==============
Hash Code is coding competition hosted by Google. I have competed in the 6th
Annual Hash Code competition with Luke Weber, Logan Weber, and Shyam Gopal.
Here is a blob from the official Hash Code Team of Google:

    "Googleâ€™s team-based programming competition, Hash Code, allows you to
    share your skills and connect with other coders as you work together to
    solve a problem modeled off a real Google engineering challenge! In small
    teams of two to four, coders all over the world will tackle the first
    problem through an Online Qualification Round. Though this round is hosted
    online, teams can come together to compete side-by-side in locally
    coordinated Hash Code hubs. The top teams from this round are invited to
    join us at an international Google office for our annual Hash Code Final
    Round."
